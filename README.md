# SearchSurge

[SearchSurge](https://my-search.surge.sh) makes it easy to tweak your search results with operators like `(site:stackoverflow.com || site:github.com)`.
Chaining many of these operators gives you search superpowers, but it's also a handful to type each time you want to allow or block many sites.
With SearchSurge, you can manage your allowed and blocked sites with ease, switch between search modes and decide which search engine to use.
